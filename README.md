## Summary

This summary section is pretty much a small snippet to what i had learnt so far with react.

This app was a fun example of how list components as well as forms are used in react, we learnt a lot more about state which is a fundamental thing to know, and probably one of the most important things in react.

As well as this I now have a good understanding of how things like todo lists would work in react

Below we can see a list of summarized learning points and feel free to ask or dm me about them so i can go more into depth:

- List based components
- State and multiple state management
- Form components
- How to create and delete components inside components
- Lifting up state
- Deriving State

and more

## TO DO

This project while small in scale now has the very real potential to become a large scale app with time and knowledge gained and i look forward to working on it
